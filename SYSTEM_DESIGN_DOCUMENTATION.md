## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data access logic
- Provides clean separation between business logic and data persistence
- Uses Spring Data JPA for automatic implementation

### 2. Service Layer Pattern
- Encapsulates business logic
- Provides transaction boundaries
- Coordinates between multiple repositories

### 3. DTO Pattern
- Separates internal domain models from external API contracts
- Provides data transformation and aggregation
- Reduces over-fetching of data

### 4. MVC Pattern
- Clear separation between Model (entities), View (templates), and Controller (REST endpoints)
- Promotes maintainability and testability

## Database Design

### Core Tables
- **patients** - Central patient information
- **doctors** - Healthcare provider information
- **visits** - Patient-doctor encounters
- **diagnoses** - Medical diagnoses per visit
- **prescriptions** - Medication prescriptions per visit
- **patient_cohorts** - Patient groupings for analytics
- **cohort_criteria** - Rules for cohort membership

### Relationships
- Patient → Visit (1:N)
- Doctor → Visit (1:N)
- Visit → Diagnosis (1:N)
- Visit → Prescription (1:N)
- PatientCohort → Patient (N:N)
- PatientCohort → CohortCriteria (1:N)

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys on all tables
- Unique indexes on business keys (MRN, license numbers)
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Date-based indexes for temporal queries

## API Design

### RESTful Endpoints
- Follows REST conventions for resource manipulation
- Consistent response formats
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination support for large datasets

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Basic Spring Security setup
- Development-friendly configuration (permits all requests)
- CSRF protection disabled for API endpoints
- Stateless session management

### Production Recommendations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Enable CSRF protection for web forms
- Add method-level security
- Implement audit logging
- Add input validation and sanitization

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
- Lazy loading for entity relationships
- Pagination for large result sets
- Query optimization for analytics operations

### Caching Strategy
- Cache patient analytics calculations
- Cache cohort results

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless application design supports horizontal scaling
- Database can be externalized (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Consider microservices architecture for large deployments

### Vertical Scaling
- Optimize JVM settings
- Database connection pooling
- Async processing for long-running analytics

## Monitoring and Observability

- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for service layer
- Integration tests for repository layer
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Test data management

### Deployment
- Docker containerization
- Environment-specific configurations
